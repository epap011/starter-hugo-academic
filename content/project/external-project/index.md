The Alpha Programming Language project aims to design and implement an alpha programming language from scratch. The project encompasses all phases of language development, including lexical analysis, grammar specification, intermediate code generation, virtual machine design, and target code generation. The primary objective is to create a robust and efficient programming language that can be used for various application domains.Throughout the project, rigorous testing and debugging will be conducted to ensure the correctness and efficiency of each phase's implementation.
